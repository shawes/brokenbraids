Surely this has to be the piece de resistance, an authentic 70s handkerchief hem dress with floral chevron border, adjustable shoestring strap and elasticized waist. Pieces like these are know increasingly rare and this shrinking violet has set in my closet for far too long! Gorgeous and one I would continue to keep if only purple was my colour. Note that there is some pull on the left shoestring strap as pictured and the bottom half is semi sheer and would benefit from an inner slip. Does up with a central zipper at back amidst all the blousons nature of the top.
